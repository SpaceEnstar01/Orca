Tutorials offer step-by-step guidance on utilizing the Orca Arm in Lerobot framework.

# ORCA Robotic Arm

## Concept
The ORCA is a research-grade, 6-DOF robotic arm that bridges the critical gap between industrial hardware and the world of embodied AI research. The product is in its late development stage, with hardware design and core software integration already complete. Its concept is to provide a **turnkey solution for robotic imitation learning**.  

Unlike other systems that require users to spend months integrating hardware with complex software, ORCA works out-of-the-box, providing a seamless workflow from data collection to AI model deployment.

## Key Features
- **Axis Configuration**: Industrial-grade 6-Degrees-of-Freedom (6-DOF) articulation, enabling complex manipulation and orientation for sophisticated tasks.  
- **Hardware Platform**: Robust construction utilizing high-precision decelerated motors, ensuring the repeatability and reliability required for industrial scenarios and consistent AI data collection.  
- **Embodied Intelligence Integration**: Natively and fully integrated with core embodied intelligence algorithm frameworks, including **LeRobot** and **ALOHA**.
